	This implementation of the map reduce framework isn't very memory intense as it's only doing sorting.  For this reason, threads have better performance than processes.  Creating a process requires the system to duplicate the parent process so it has to spend time making those copies.  This is very useful for larger programs that use much larger databases that also need high reliability, but this implementation is small.  Threads split the process into parts and assign each part gets assigned to a core.  They share the same memory space and can communicate to each other directly so the run time should be faster for small programs like the one in this assignment.
