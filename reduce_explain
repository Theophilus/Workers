	The reduce function's goal is to take the data that the map saved into shared memory and then sort and combine it into one output file.  The way this function works is it splits the merge sort process between different cores either by forking or by creating threads.  Each process/thread takes two of the data structures in shared memory and mergesorts them.  This creates one sorted data structure from two different ones.  This is repeated until the only data structure left in shared memory is the output data structure.  The reduce then passes the pointer to this data structure to the print function to print the results.  While the reduce mergesorts, if the input file is for wordcount, the reduce will make sure to not repeat words and instead add the counts together.  If the input file is for number sort, then normal merge sort process works.
